# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction using RNN

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict **tomorrow's temperature** based on historical weather data. The model is trained on time series data and utilizes deep learning techniques to capture temporal patterns for accurate forecasting.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts next-day temperature
- Uses RNN/LSTM architecture
- Trained on historical weather time series data
- Built with TensorFlow / Keras
- Visualizations of predictions vs actual data

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Input: Historical daily temperature data
- Layers:
  - Recurrent Layer (RNN / LSTM )
  - Dense Output Layer
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam
